I am an exporter for code solutions created for the Pharo language track of Exercism.io.

In keeping with Exercism convention, solutions should be exported to the directory HOME/exercism/pharo/<exercise> where <exercise> is the name of the class being exported, and the name of the exercise the solution is for. The value for this directory is available in the class method #exercismDirectory in the 'constants' protocol.

Instance Variables
homeDirectory - The users HOME directory, typically available as an environment variable from the Operating System.
exercismDirectory - The directory containing the Exercism exercises. This will typically be 'exercism/pharo/'.

Constants
exercismDirectory - The directory to which files will be exported.
fileExtension - The file extension of the exported code file.
